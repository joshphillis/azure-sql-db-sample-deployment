# 🗄️ Azure SQL Database Deployment — Logical Server, Sample Data & VM Connectivity

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how to deploy an **Azure SQL Database** under a logical SQL Server with secure authentication, networking configuration, and sample data provisioning. It includes access validation through both the Azure Portal and **Azure Data Studio**, plus firewall integration with a linked Windows-based virtual machine.

This repository has been sanitized to remove all sensitive cloud resource identifiers, including login credentials, security group names, public IPs, VPC and subnet IDs, and resource deletion steps. Any environment-specific values presented (such as sample firewall rules or admin logins) have been intentionally generic and are used solely for instructional purposes.

All actions documented in this project follow Microsoft Azure best practices for authentication, access control, and resource protection. Always ensure keys, credentials, and infrastructure metadata are stored securely and never pushed to public repositories.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Azure SQL Database** – Cloud-hosted relational DB  
- **Azure SQL Server** – Logical container (`glsqlserver02`)  
- **AdventureWorksLT Sample Data** – Loaded for query testing  
- **Resource Group** – `GL-SQL-RG` for organized resource management  
- **Virtual Machine** – Windows 10 Pro VM (`GL-SQL-VM`)  
- **Firewall Rules** – Configured public IP access  
- **Azure Data Studio** – GUI-based SQL query execution

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

### Step 1: Create Resource Group  
Deployed `GL-SQL-RG` in East US to organize SQL and VM resources.

### Step 2: Provision Azure SQL Server  
- Server name: `glsqlserver02`  
- Location: East US  
- Authentication: SQL authentication (`mbadmin`)

### Step 3: Deploy SQL Database  
- Database name: `SampleDB`  
- Tier: General Purpose (Serverless)  
- Loaded sample schema: `AdventureWorksLT`

### Step 4: Create Virtual Machine  
- VM name: `GL-SQL-VM`  
- OS: Windows 10 Pro  
- Zone: East US  
- Credentials: `gladmin / Password1Password2`

### Step 5: Configure Firewall Rule  
- Rule name: `AzureVMAccess`  
- IP range: `40.76.251.110`  
- Enabled access from the VM to SQL Server

### Step 6: Test Access  
- Connected to `SampleDB` using Azure Data Studio  
- Ran: `SELECT * FROM [SalesLT].[Customer]`  
- Verified dataset retrieval and server responsiveness

## ✅ Outcomes  
- Successfully deployed and queried Azure SQL Database with sample data  
- Integrated VM access via firewall rule and public IP  
- Used GUI tools to confirm network access and data interaction  
- Gained experience in Azure networking, DB provisioning, and authentication flow
